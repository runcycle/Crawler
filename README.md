# Crawler
Sorting Through Data

- I started out by creating a url validation if/else statement.  It wasn't required by the rules of the challenge, but I was envisioning this crawler as part of an actual web page, where I would need to filter out text, images, etc to grab only urls.

- The regex pattern I used allows data that begins with "http://" but unfortunately it also allows bascially everything else.  It needs work.
